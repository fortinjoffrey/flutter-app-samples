# flutter_app_samples


# TODO
- Complete README with the following information:
  - What's the minimal flutter version for this project (and recommend one)
  - What are the app features ?
  - What are code arch, code features, tests...
- Rethink error handling
  - Should the data layer redefine its own DataException ? Is it worth it ?
  - Enrich the Failure union with more domain failures. How much should the domain know about what happens in data ?
